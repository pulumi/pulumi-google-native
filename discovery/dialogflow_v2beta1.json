Using contexts, you can control the flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names. When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that correspond to the currently active contexts.

In general, the expression must specify the field name, a comparison operator, and the value to use for filtering: - The value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. - The comparison operator must be either `=`,`!=`, `\u003e`, or `\u003c`. - To filter on multiple expressions, separate the expressions with `AND` or `OR` (omitting both implies `AND`). - For clarity, expressions can be enclosed in parentheses. Only `lifecycle_state` can be filtered on in this way. For example, the following expression only returns `COMPLETED` conversations: `lifecycle_state = \"COMPLETED\"` For more information about filtering, see [API Filtering](https://aip.dev/160)."

For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.",
