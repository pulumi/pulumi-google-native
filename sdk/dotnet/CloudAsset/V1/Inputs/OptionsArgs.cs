        /// Optional. If true, the response will include access analysis from identities to resources via service account impersonation. This is a very expensive operation, because many derived queries will be executed. We highly recommend you use AssetService.AnalyzeIamPolicyLongrunning RPC instead. For example, if the request analyzes for which resources user A has permission P, and there's an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission to a service account SA, and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Another example, if the request analyzes for who has permission P to a Google Cloud folder F, and there's an IAM policy states user A has iam.serviceAccounts.actAs permission to a service account SA, and there's another IAM policy states service account SA has permission P to the Google Cloud folder F, then user A potentially has access to the Google Cloud folder F. And those advanced analysis results will be included in AnalyzeIamPolicyResponse.service_account_impersonation_analysis. Only the following permissions are considered in this analysis: * `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` * `iam.serviceAccounts.signBlob` * `iam.serviceAccounts.signJwt` * `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken` * `iam.serviceAccounts.getOpenIdToken` * `iam.serviceAccounts.implicitDelegation` Default is false.

If true and IamPolicyAnalysisQuery.resource_selector is specified, the resource section of the result will expand the specified resource to include resources lower in the resource hierarchy. Only project or lower resources are supported. Folder and organization resources cannot be used together with this option. For example, if the request analyzes for which users have permission P on a Google Cloud project with this option enabled, the results will include all users who have permission P on that project or any lower resource.
