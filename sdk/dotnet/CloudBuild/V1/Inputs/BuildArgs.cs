Fields can include the following variables, which will be expanded when the build is created: - $PROJECT_ID: the project ID of the build. - $PROJECT_NUMBER: the project number of the build. - $BUILD_ID: the autogenerated ID of the build. - $REPO_NAME: the source repository name specified by RepoSource. - $BRANCH_NAME: the branch name specified by RepoSource. - $TAG_NAME: the tag name specified by RepoSource. - $REVISION_ID or $COMMIT_SHA: the commit SHA specified by RepoSource or resolved from the specified branch or tag. - $SHORT_SHA: first 7 characters of $REVISION_ID or $COMMIT_SHA.
