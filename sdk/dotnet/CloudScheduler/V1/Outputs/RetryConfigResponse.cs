A job's retry interval starts at min_backoff_duration, then doubles `max_doublings` times, then increases linearly, and finally retries at intervals of max_backoff_duration up to retry_count times. For example, if min_backoff_duration is 10s, max_backoff_duration is 300s, and `max_doublings` is 3, then the a job will first be retried in 10s. The retry interval will double three times, and then increase linearly by 2^3 * 10s. Finally, the job will retry at intervals of max_backoff_duration until the job has been attempted retry_count times. Thus, the requests will retry at 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, 160s, 240s, 300s, 300s, ....
