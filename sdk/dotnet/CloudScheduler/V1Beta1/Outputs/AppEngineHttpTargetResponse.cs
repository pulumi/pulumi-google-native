Cloud Scheduler sets some headers to default values: * `User-Agent`: By default, this header is `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"`. This header can be modified, but Cloud Scheduler will append `"AppEngine-Google; (+http://code.google.com/appengine)"` to the modified `User-Agent`. * `X-CloudScheduler`: This header will be set to true. If the job has an body, Cloud Scheduler sets the following headers: * `Content-Type`: By default, the `Content-Type` header is set to `"application/octet-stream"`. The default can be overridden by explictly setting `Content-Type` to a particular media type when the job is created. For example, `Content-Type` can be set to `"application/json"`. * `Content-Length`: This is computed by Cloud Scheduler. This value is output only. It cannot be changed. The headers below are output only. They cannot be set or overridden: * `X-Google-*`: For Google internal use only. * `X-AppEngine-*`: For Google internal use only. In addition, some App Engine headers, which contain job-specific information, are also be sent to the job handler.
