That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue's state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
