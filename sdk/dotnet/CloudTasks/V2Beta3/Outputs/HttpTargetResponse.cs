These headers represent a subset of the headers that will be configured for the task's HTTP request. Some HTTP request headers will be ignored or replaced. A partial list of headers that will be ignored or replaced is: * Several predefined headers, prefixed with "X-CloudTasks-", can be used to define properties of the task. * Host: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks and derived from HttpRequest.url. * Content-Length: This will be computed by Cloud Tasks. `Content-Type` won't be set by Cloud Tasks. You can explicitly set `Content-Type` to a media type when the task is created. For example,`Content-Type` can be set to `"application/octet-stream"` or `"application/json"`. The default value is set to `"application/json"`. * User-Agent: This will be set to `"Google-Cloud-Tasks"`. Headers which can have multiple values (according to RFC2616) can be specified using comma-separated values. The size of the headers must be less than 80KB. Queue-level headers to override headers of all the tasks in the queue. Do not put business sensitive or personally identifying data in the HTTP Header Override Configuration or other similar fields in accordance with Section 12 (Resource Fields) of the [Service Specific Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms).
