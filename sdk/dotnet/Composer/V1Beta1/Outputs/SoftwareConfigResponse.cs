Section names must not contain hyphens ("-"), opening square brackets ("["), or closing square brackets ("]"). The property name must not be empty and must not contain an equals sign ("=") or semicolon (";"). Section and property names must not contain a period ("."). Apache Airflow configuration property names must be written in [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). Property values can contain any character, and can be written in any lower/upper case format. Certain Apache Airflow configuration property values are [blocked](/composer/docs/concepts/airflow-configurations), and cannot be overridden.

It must match the regular expression `composer-([0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+|latest)-airflow-[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+.*)?`. When used as input, the server also checks if the provided version is supported and denies the request for an unsupported version. The Cloud Composer portion of the version is a [semantic version](https://semver.org) or `latest`. When the patch version is omitted, the current Cloud Composer patch version is selected. When `latest` is provided instead of an explicit version number, the server replaces `latest` with the current Cloud Composer version and stores that version number in the same field. The portion of the image version that follows *airflow-* is an official Apache Airflow repository [release name](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/releases). See also [Version List](/composer/docs/concepts/versioning/composer-versions).
