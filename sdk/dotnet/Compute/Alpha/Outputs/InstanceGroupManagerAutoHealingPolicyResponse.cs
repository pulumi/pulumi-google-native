This initial delay allows instances to initialize and run their startup scripts before the instance group determines that they are UNHEALTHY. This prevents the managed instance group from recreating its instances prematurely. This value must be from range [0, 3600].

The instance is considered available if all of the following conditions are satisfied: 1. Instance's status is RUNNING. 2. Instance's currentAction is NONE (in particular its liveness health check result was observed to be HEALTHY at least once as it passed VERIFYING). 3. There is no outgoing action on an instance triggered by IGM. By default, number of concurrently autohealed instances is smaller than the managed instance group target size. However, if a zonal managed instance group has only one instance, or a regional managed instance group has only one instance per zone, autohealing will recreate these instances when they become unhealthy.
