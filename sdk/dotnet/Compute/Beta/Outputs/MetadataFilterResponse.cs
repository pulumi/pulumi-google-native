    /// Opaque filter criteria used by loadbalancers to restrict routing configuration to a limited set of loadbalancing proxies. Proxies and sidecars involved in loadbalancing would typically present metadata to the loadbalancers which need to match criteria specified here. If a match takes place, the relevant configuration is made available to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the metadata. An example for using metadataFilters would be: if loadbalancing involves Envoys, they will only receive routing configuration when values in metadataFilters match values supplied in of their XDS requests to loadbalancers.
