URL mask allows for routing to multiple App Engine services without having to create multiple Network Endpoint Groups and backend services. For example, the request URLs foo1-dot-appname.appspot.com/v1 and foo1-dot-appname.appspot.com/v2 can be backed by the same Serverless NEG with URL mask &lt;service&gt;-dot-appname.appspot.com/&lt;version&gt;. The URL mask will parse them to { service = "foo1", version = "v1" } and { service = "foo1", version = "v2" } respectively.
