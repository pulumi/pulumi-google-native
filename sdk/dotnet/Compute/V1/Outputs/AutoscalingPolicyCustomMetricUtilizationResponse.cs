        /// For the filter to be valid for autoscaling purposes, the following rules apply:  
        /// - You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors.

        /// - You can specify the metric in both the filter string and in the metric field. However, if specified in both places, the metric must be identical. 
        /// - The monitored resource type determines what kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a separate TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot filter on resource labels.
        /// If the resource type is any other value, the autoscaler expects this metric to contain values that apply to the entire autoscaled instance group and resource label filtering can be performed to point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
