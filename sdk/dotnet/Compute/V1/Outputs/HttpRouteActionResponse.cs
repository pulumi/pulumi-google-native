As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can be introduced by a load balancer on a percentage of requests before sending those requests to the backend service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load balancer for a percentage of requests. For the requests impacted by fault injection, timeout and retry_policy is ignored by clients that are configured with a fault_injection_policy.
