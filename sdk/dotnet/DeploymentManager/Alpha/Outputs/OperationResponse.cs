    /// Represents an Operation resource. Google Compute Engine has three Operation resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/globalOperations) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/regionOperations) * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/{$api_version}/zoneOperations) You can use an operation resource to manage asynchronous API requests. For more information, read Handling API responses. Operations can be global, regional or zonal. - For global operations, use the `globalOperations` resource. - For regional operations, use the `regionOperations` resource. - For zonal operations, use the `zonalOperations` resource. For more information, read Global, Regional, and Zonal Resources.
