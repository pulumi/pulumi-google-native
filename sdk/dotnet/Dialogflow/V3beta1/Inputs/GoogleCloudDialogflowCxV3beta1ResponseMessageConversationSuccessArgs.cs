Note that Dialogflow also considers conversations that get to the conversation end page as successful even if they don't return ConversationSuccess. You may set this, for example: * In the entry_fulfillment of a Page if entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded. * In a webhook response when you determine that you handled the customer issue.
