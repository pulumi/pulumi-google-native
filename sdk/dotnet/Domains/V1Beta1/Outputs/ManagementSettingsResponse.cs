You cannot use `RENEWAL_DISABLED` during resource creation, and you can update the renewal status only when the `Registration` resource has state `ACTIVE` or `SUSPENDED`. When `preferred_renewal_method` is set to `AUTOMATIC_RENEWAL`, the actual `renewal_method` can be set to `RENEWAL_DISABLED` in case of problems with the billing account or reported domain abuse. In such cases, check the `issues` field on the `Registration`. After the problem is resolved, the `renewal_method` is automatically updated to `preferred_renewal_method` in a few hours.
