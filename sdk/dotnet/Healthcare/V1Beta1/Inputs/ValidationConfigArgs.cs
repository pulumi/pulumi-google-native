For example, to use the US Core profiles for validation, set `enabled_implementation_guides` to `["http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ImplementationGuide/ig"]`. If `enabled_implementation_guides` is empty or omitted, then incoming resources are only required to conform to the base FHIR profiles. Otherwise, a resource must conform to at least one profile listed in the `global` property of one of the enabled ImplementationGuides. The Cloud Healthcare API does not currently enforce all of the rules in a StructureDefinition. The following rules are supported: - min/max - minValue/maxValue - maxLength - type - fixed[x] - pattern[x] on simple types - slicing, when using "value" as the discriminator type When a URL cannot be resolved (for example, in a type assertion), the server does not return an error.
