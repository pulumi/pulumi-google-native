For an actual value x, the scorecard is in a danger state if x is less than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers below, or greater than or equal to a danger threshold that triggers above. Similarly, if x is above/below a warning threshold that triggers above/below, then the scorecard is in a warning state - unless x also puts it in a danger state. (Danger trumps warning.)As an example, consider a scorecard with the following four thresholds: { value: 90, category: 'DANGER', trigger: 'ABOVE', }, { value: 70, category: 'WARNING', trigger: 'ABOVE', }, { value: 10, category: 'DANGER', trigger: 'BELOW', }, { value: 20, category: 'WARNING', trigger: 'BELOW', }Then: values less than or equal to 10 would put the scorecard in a DANGER state, values greater than 10 but less than or equal to 20 a WARNING state, values strictly between 20 and 70 an OK state, values greater than or equal to 70 but less than 90 a WARNING state, and values greater than or equal to 90 a DANGER state.
