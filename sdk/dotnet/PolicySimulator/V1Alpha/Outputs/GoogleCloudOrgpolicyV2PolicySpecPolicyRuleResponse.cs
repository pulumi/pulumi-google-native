Each subexpression must be of the form "resource.matchTag('/tag_key_short_name, 'tag_value_short_name')". or "resource.matchTagId('tagKeys/key_id', 'tagValues/value_id')". where key_name and value_name are the resource names for Label Keys and Values. These names are available from the Tag Manager Service. An example expression is: "resource.matchTag('123456789/environment, 'prod')". or "resource.matchTagId('tagKeys/123', 'tagValues/456')".
