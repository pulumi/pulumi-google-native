    /// A Cardinality condition for the Waiter resource. A cardinality condition is met when the number of variables under a specified path prefix reaches a predefined number. For example, if you set a Cardinality condition where the `path` is set to `/foo` and the number of paths is set to `2`, the following variables would meet the condition in a RuntimeConfig resource: + `/foo/variable1 = "value1"` + `/foo/variable2 = "value2"` + `/bar/variable3 = "value3"` It would not satisfy the same condition with the `number` set to `3`, however, because there is only 2 paths that start with `/foo`. Cardinality conditions are recursive; all subtrees under the specific path prefix are counted.
