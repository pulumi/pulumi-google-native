Restrictions: * The entire annotations dictionary may contain up to 512 characters, spread accoss all key-value pairs. Annotations that go beyond this limit are rejected * Valid annotation keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a slash (/). The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (.), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (/) Annotations that fails to meet these requirements are rejected. * The `(*.)google.com/` and `(*.)googleapis.com/` prefixes are reserved for system annotations managed by Service Directory. If the user tries to write to these keyspaces, those entries are silently ignored by the system Note: This field is equivalent to the `metadata` field in the v1beta1 API. They have the same syntax and read/write to the same location in Service Directory.
