Restrictions: * The entire metadata dictionary may contain up to 2000 characters, spread accoss all key-value pairs. Metadata that goes beyond this limit are rejected * Valid metadata keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a slash (/). The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (.), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (/). Metadata that fails to meet these requirements are rejected * The `(*.)google.com/` and `(*.)googleapis.com/` prefixes are reserved for system metadata managed by Service Directory. If the user tries to write to these keyspaces, those entries are silently ignored by the system Note: This field is equivalent to the `annotations` field in the v1 API. They have the same syntax and read/write to the same location in Service Directory.
