The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (.), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (/). Annotations that fails to meet these requirements are rejected * The `(*.)google.com/` and `(*.)googleapis.com/` prefixes are reserved for system annotations managed by Service Directory. If the user tries to write to these keyspaces, those entries are silently ignored by the system Note: This field is equivalent to the `metadata` field in the v1beta1 API.
