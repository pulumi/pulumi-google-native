For example, if you send an outbound request on June 1 one millisecond prior to midnight UTC and the Storage Transfer Service server receives the request on June 2, then it will create a TransferJob with `schedule_start_date` set to June 2 and a `start_time_of_day` set to midnight UTC. The first scheduled TransferOperation will take place on June 3 at midnight UTC.
