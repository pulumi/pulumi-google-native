Customer-managed encryption keys do not protect disk metadata. If the customer-managed encryption key is rotated, when the workstation instance is stopped, the system attempts to recreate the persistent disk with the new version of the key. Be sure to keep older versions of the key until the persistent disk is recreated. Otherwise, data on the persistent disk might be lost.

The `idleTimeout` and `runningTimeout` parameters are independent of each other. Note that the `runningTimeout` parameter shuts down VMs after the specified time, regardless of whether or not the VMs are idle. Provide duration terminated by `s` for seconds—for example, `54000s` (15 hours). Defaults to `43200s` (12 hours). A value of `0` indicates that workstations using this configuration should never time out. If `encryption_key` is set, it must be greater than `0` and less than `86400s` (24 hours). Warning: A value of `0s` indicates that Cloud Workstations VMs created with this configuration have no maximum running time. This is strongly discouraged because you incur costs and will not pick up security updates.
