// Creates an API product in an organization. You create API products after you have proxied backend services using API proxies. An API product is a collection of API resources combined with quota settings and metadata that you can use to deliver customized and productized API bundles to your developer community. This metadata can include: - Scope - Environments - API proxies - Extensible profile API products enable you repackage APIs on-the-fly, without having to do any additional coding or configuration. Apigee recommends that you start with a simple API product including only required elements. You then provision credentials to apps to enable them to start testing your APIs. After you have authentication and authorization working against a simple API product, you can iterate to create finer grained API products, defining different sets of API resources for each API product. **WARNING:** - If you don't specify an API proxy in the request body, *any* app associated with the product can make calls to *any* API in your entire organization. - If you don't specify an environment in the request body, the product allows access to all environments. For more information, see What is an API product?

In this case, the API keys won't work until they have been explicitly approved. If set to `auto`, the consumer key is generated and returned in "approved" state and can be used immediately. **Note:** Typically, `auto` is used to provide access to free or trial API products that provide limited quota or capabilities.

Use this property to specify the access level of the API product as either `public`, `private`, or `internal`. Only products marked `public` are available to developers in the Apigee developer portal. For example, you can set a product to `internal` while it is in development and then change access to `public` when it is ready to release on the portal.

For example, if the `apiResources` element is defined to be `/forecastrss` and the base path defined for the API proxy is `/weather`, then only requests to `/weather/forecastrss` are permitted by the API product. You can select a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with the following wildcard: - `/**`: Indicates that all sub-URIs are included. - `/*` : Indicates that only URIs one level down are included. By default, / supports the same resources as /** as well as the base path defined by the API proxy. For example, if the base path of the API proxy is `/v1/weatherapikey`, then the API product supports requests to `/v1/weatherapikey` and to any sub-URIs, such as `/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss`, `/v1/weatherapikey/region/CA`, and so on.
