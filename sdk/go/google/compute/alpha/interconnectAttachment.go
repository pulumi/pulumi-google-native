Enum values ACTIVE and UNPROVISIONED are shared by DEDICATED/PRIVATE, PARTNER, and PARTNER_PROVIDER interconnect attachments, while enum values PENDING_PARTNER, PARTNER_REQUEST_RECEIVED, and PENDING_CUSTOMER are used for only PARTNER and PARTNER_PROVIDER interconnect attachments. This state can take one of the following values: - ACTIVE: The attachment has been turned up and is ready to use. - UNPROVISIONED: The attachment is not ready to use yet, because turnup is not complete. - PENDING_PARTNER: A newly-created PARTNER attachment that has not yet been configured on the Partner side. - PARTNER_REQUEST_RECEIVED: A PARTNER attachment is in the process of provisioning after a PARTNER_PROVIDER attachment was created that references it. - PENDING_CUSTOMER: A PARTNER or PARTNER_PROVIDER attachment that is waiting for a customer to activate it. - DEFUNCT: The attachment was deleted externally and is no longer functional. This could be because the associated Interconnect was removed, or because the other side of a Partner attachment was deleted.
