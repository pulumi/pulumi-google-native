// Creates a subnetwork in the specified project using the data included in the request.
type Subnetwork struct {
	pulumi.CustomResourceState

	// Whether this subnetwork's ranges can conflict with existing static routes. Setting this to true allows this subnetwork's primary and secondary ranges to overlap with (and contain) static routes that have already been configured on the corresponding network. For example if a static route has range 10.1.0.0/16, a subnet range 10.0.0.0/8 could only be created if allow_conflicting_routes=true. Overlapping is only allowed on subnetwork operations; routes whose ranges conflict with this subnetwork's ranges won't be allowed unless route.allow_conflicting_subnetworks is set to true. Typically packets destined to IPs within the subnetwork (which may contain private/sensitive data) are prevented from leaving the virtual network. Setting this field to true will disable this feature. The default value is false and applies to all existing subnetworks and automatically created subnetworks. This field cannot be set to true at resource creation time.
	AllowSubnetCidrRoutesOverlap pulumi.BoolOutput `pulumi:"allowSubnetCidrRoutesOverlap"`
	// Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.
	CreationTimestamp pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"creationTimestamp"`

	Description pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"description"`
	// Whether to enable flow logging for this subnetwork. If this field is not explicitly set, it will not appear in get listings. If not set the default behavior is determined by the org policy, if there is no org policy specified, then it will default to disabled. This field isn't supported with the purpose field set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
	EnableFlowLogs pulumi.BoolOutput `pulumi:"enableFlowLogs"`
	// The range of external IPv6 addresses that are owned by this subnetwork.
	ExternalIpv6Prefix pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"externalIpv6Prefix"`
	// Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field will be ignored when inserting a Subnetwork. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the Subnetwork, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a Subnetwork.

	// The gateway address for default routes to reach destination addresses outside this subnetwork.
	GatewayAddress pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"gatewayAddress"`
	// The range of internal addresses that are owned by this subnetwork. Provide this property when you create the subnetwork. For example, 10.0.0.0/8 or 100.64.0.0/10. Ranges must be unique and non-overlapping within a network. Only IPv4 is supported. This field is set at resource creation time. The range can be any range listed in the Valid ranges list. The range can be expanded after creation using expandIpCidrRange.
	IpCidrRange pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"ipCidrRange"`
