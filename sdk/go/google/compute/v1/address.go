Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`. The first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters (except for the last character) must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit.

	// - `VPC_PEERING` for addresses that are reserved for VPC peer networks.
	// - `NAT_AUTO` for addresses that are external IP addresses automatically reserved for Cloud NAT.
	// - `IPSEC_INTERCONNECT` for addresses created from a private IP range that are reserved for a VLAN attachment in an IPsec-encrypted Cloud Interconnect configuration. These addresses are regional resources.
	Purpose *string `pulumi:"purpose"`

	Region *string `pulumi:"region"`
	// An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed.
	//
	// For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.
