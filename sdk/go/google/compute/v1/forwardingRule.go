	// Packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to target or  backend_service. You can only use one of ports, port_range, or allPorts. The three are mutually exclusive. Forwarding rules with the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair must have disjoint port ranges.
	//
	// Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable ports:
	// - TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080
	// - TargetHttpsProxy: 443
	// - TargetGrpcProxy: no constraints
	// - TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995, 1688, 1883, 5222
	// - TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995, 1688, 1883, 5222
	// - TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500
	PortRange pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The ports field is only supported when the forwarding rule references a backend_service directly. Supported load balancing products are Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing. Only packets addressed to the specified list of ports are forwarded to backends.
	//
	// You can only use one of ports and port_range, or allPorts. The three are mutually exclusive.
	//
	// You can specify a list of up to five ports, which can be non-contiguous.
	//
	// For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, if you specify allPorts, you should not specify ports.
	//
	// For more information, see [Port specifications](/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#port_specifications).
	Ports   pulumi.StringArrayInput

	// It is only supported for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing.
	ServiceDirectoryRegistrations ForwardingRuleServiceDirectoryRegistrationArrayInput
	// An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding Rule. If specified, the prefix is the first label of the fully qualified service name.
	//
	// The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

	ServiceName pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// This field is only used for internal load balancing.
	//
	// For internal load balancing, this field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule.
	//
	// If the network specified is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional. However, if the network is in custom subnet mode, a subnetwork must be specified.
