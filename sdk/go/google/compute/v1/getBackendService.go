For more information, refer to Choosing a load balancer.
	LoadBalancingScheme string `pulumi:"loadBalancingScheme"`
	// The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of the locality. The possible values are:
	// - ROUND_ROBIN: This is a simple policy in which each healthy backend is selected in round robin order. This is the default.
	// - LEAST_REQUEST: An O(1) algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active requests.
	// - RING_HASH: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests.
	// - RANDOM: The load balancer selects a random healthy host.
	// - ORIGINAL_DESTINATION: Backend host is selected based on the client connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address as the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection was redirected to the load balancer.
	// - MAGLEV: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and host selection times. For more information about Maglev, see https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824
	//
	// This field is applicable to either:
	// - A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.

	LogConfig BackendServiceLogConfigResponse `pulumi:"logConfig"`
	// Specifies the default maximum duration (timeout) for streams to this service. Duration is computed from the beginning of the stream until the response has been completely processed, including all retries. A stream that does not complete in this duration is closed.
	// If not specified, there will be no timeout limit, i.e. the maximum duration is infinite.
	// This field is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
	MaxStreamDuration DurationResponse `pulumi:"maxStreamDuration"`
	// Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
