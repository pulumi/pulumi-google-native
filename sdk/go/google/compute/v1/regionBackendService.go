	//
	// If sessionAffinity is not NONE, and this field is not set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH, session affinity settings will not take effect.
	//
	// Only the default ROUND_ROBIN policy is supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
	LocalityLbPolicy *RegionBackendServiceLocalityLbPolicy
	// This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer traffic served by this backend service. If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver.
	LogConfig BackendServiceLogConfigPtrInput
	// Specifies the default maximum duration (timeout) for streams to this service. Duration is computed from the beginning of the stream until the response has been completely processed, including all retries. A stream that does not complete in this duration is closed.
	// If not specified, there will be no timeout limit, i.e. the maximum duration is infinite.
	// This field is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
	MaxStreamDuration DurationPtrInput
	// Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
	Name pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// The URL of the network to which this backend service belongs. This field can only be specified when the load balancing scheme is set to INTERNAL.
	Network pulumi.StringPtrInput
	// Settings controlling the eviction of unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool for the backend service. If not set, this feature is considered disabled.
	//
	// This field is applicable to either:
	// - A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.
	// - A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
	//
	// Not supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
	OutlierDetection OutlierDetectionPtrInput
	// A named port on a backend instance group representing the port for communication to the backend VMs in that group. Required when the loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL (except Network Load Balancing), INTERNAL_MANAGED, or  INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED and the backends are instance groups. The named port must be defined on each backend instance group. This parameter has no meaning if the backends are NEGs.
	//
	// Backend services for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing require you omit port_name.
	PortName pulumi.StringPtrInput
	Project  pulumi.StringInput
	// The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with backends.
	//
	// Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, TCP, SSL, UDP or GRPC. depending on the chosen load balancer or Traffic Director configuration. Refer to the documentation for the load balancer or for Traffic Director for more information.
	//
	// Must be set to GRPC when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy.
	Protocol  *RegionBackendServiceProtocol
	Region    pulumi.StringInput

	// This field specifies the security policy that applies to this backend service. This field is applicable to either:
	// - A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED.
	// - A global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
	SecuritySettings SecuritySettingsPtrInput
	// Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE.
	//
	// When the loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL: * For Network Load Balancing, the possible values are NONE, CLIENT_IP, CLIENT_IP_PROTO, or  CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO. * For all other load balancers that use loadBalancingScheme=EXTERNAL, the possible values are NONE, CLIENT_IP, or GENERATED_COOKIE. * You can use GENERATED_COOKIE if the protocol is HTTP, HTTP2, or HTTPS.
	//
	// When the loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL, possible values are NONE, CLIENT_IP, CLIENT_IP_PROTO, or CLIENT_IP_PORT_PROTO.
	//
	// When the loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_MANAGED, possible values are NONE, CLIENT_IP, GENERATED_COOKIE, HEADER_FIELD, or HTTP_COOKIE.

	// Not supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true.
	SessionAffinity *RegionBackendServiceSessionAffinity
	// The backend service timeout has a different meaning depending on the type of load balancer. For more information see,  Backend service settings The default is 30 seconds. The full range of timeout values allowed is 1 - 2,147,483,647 seconds.
