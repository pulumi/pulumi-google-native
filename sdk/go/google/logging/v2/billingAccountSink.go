	// Required. The export destination: "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]" "bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/datasets/[DATASET]" "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]" The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).
	Destination pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"destination"`
	// Optional. If set to True, then this sink is disabled and it does not export any log entries.

Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression. For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.

Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods. First character has to be alphanumeric.
	Name pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"name"`
	// The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks.
	UpdateTime pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"updateTime"`
	// An IAM identity—a service account or group—under which Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail.
