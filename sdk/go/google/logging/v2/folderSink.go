	// Optional. A service account provided by the caller that will be used to write the log entries. The format must be serviceAccount:some@email. This field can only be specified if you are routing logs to a destination outside this sink's project. If not specified, a Logging service account will automatically be generated.

For more information, see Exporting Logs with Sinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).

If the field is true, then log entries from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression.For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent.To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:logName:("projects/test-project1/" OR "projects/test-project2/") AND resource.type=gce_instance

The sink's destination must be in the same project as the sink itself.If this field is set to true, or if the sink is owned by a non-project resource such as an organization, then the value of writer_identity will be a unique service account used only for exports from the new sink. For more information, see writer_identity in LogSink.
	UniqueWriterIdentity pulumi.BoolPtrOutput `pulumi:"uniqueWriterIdentity"`
	// The last update timestamp of the sink.This field may not be present for older sinks.
	UpdateTime pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"updateTime"`
	// An IAM identity—a service account or group—under which Cloud Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is either set by specifying custom_writer_identity or set automatically by sinks.create and sinks.update based on the value of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting Access for a Resource (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-roles-to-service-accounts#granting_access_to_a_service_account_for_a_resource). Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.Sinks that have a destination that is a log bucket in the same project as the sink cannot have a writer_identity and no additional permissions are required.
