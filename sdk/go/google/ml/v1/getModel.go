	// The default version of the model. This version will be used to handle prediction requests that do not specify a version. You can change the default version by calling projects.models.versions.setDefault.
	DefaultVersion GoogleCloudMlV1__VersionResponse `pulumi:"defaultVersion"`
	// Optional. The description specified for the model when it was created.
	Description string `pulumi:"description"`
	// `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a model from overwriting each other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-modify-write cycle to perform model updates in order to avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `GetModel`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `UpdateModel` to ensure that their change will be applied to the model as intended.
	Etag string `pulumi:"etag"`
	// Optional. One or more labels that you can add, to organize your models. Each label is a key-value pair, where both the key and the value are arbitrary strings that you supply. For more information, see the documentation on using labels.
	Labels map[string]string `pulumi:"labels"`
	// The name specified for the model when it was created. The model name must be unique within the project it is created in.
	Name string `pulumi:"name"`
	// Optional. If true, online prediction nodes send `stderr` and `stdout` streams to Cloud Logging. These can be more verbose than the standard access logs (see `onlinePredictionLogging`) and can incur higher cost. However, they are helpful for debugging. Note that [logs may incur a cost](/stackdriver/pricing), especially if your project receives prediction requests at a high QPS. Estimate your costs before enabling this option. Default is false.
	OnlinePredictionConsoleLogging bool `pulumi:"onlinePredictionConsoleLogging"`
	// Optional. If true, online prediction access logs are sent to Cloud Logging. These logs are like standard server access logs, containing information like timestamp and latency for each request. Note that [logs may incur a cost](/stackdriver/pricing), especially if your project receives prediction requests at a high queries per second rate (QPS). Estimate your costs before enabling this option. Default is false.
	OnlinePredictionLogging bool `pulumi:"onlinePredictionLogging"`
	// Optional. The list of regions where the model is going to be deployed. Only one region per model is supported. Defaults to 'us-central1' if nothing is set. See the available regions for AI Platform services. Note: * No matter where a model is deployed, it can always be accessed by users from anywhere, both for online and batch prediction. * The region for a batch prediction job is set by the region field when submitting the batch prediction job and does not take its value from this field.
	Regions []string `pulumi:"regions"`
