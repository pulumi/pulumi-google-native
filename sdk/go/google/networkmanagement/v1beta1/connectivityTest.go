// Creates a new Connectivity Test. After you create a test, the reachability analysis is performed as part of the long running operation, which completes when the analysis completes. If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are invalid (for example, containing non-existent resources in the network, or you don't have read permissions to the network configurations of listed projects), then the reachability result returns a value of `UNKNOWN`. If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are incomplete, the reachability result returns a value of AMBIGUOUS. For more information, see the Connectivity Test documentation.

You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the destination location. Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination endpoint from route information. If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination interface. A reachability analysis proceeds even if the destination location is ambiguous. However, the result can include endpoints that you don't intend to test.

You can use a combination of source IP address, virtual machine (VM) instance, or Compute Engine network to uniquely identify the source location.

Otherwise, specify the VM instance, which already contains its internal IP address and VPC network information. If the source of the test is within an on-premises network, then you must provide the destination VPC network. If the source endpoint is a Compute Engine VM instance with multiple network interfaces, the instance itself is not sufficient to identify the endpoint. So, you must also specify the source IP address or VPC network. A reachability analysis proceeds even if the source location is ambiguous. However, the test result may include endpoints that you don't intend to test.
