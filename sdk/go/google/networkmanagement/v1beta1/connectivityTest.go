// Creates a new Connectivity Test. After you create a test, the reachability analysis is performed as part of the long running operation, which completes when the analysis completes. If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are invalid (for example, containing non-existent resources in the network, or you don't have read permissions to the network configurations of listed projects), then the reachability result returns a value of `UNKNOWN`. If the endpoint specifications in `ConnectivityTest` are incomplete, the reachability result returns a value of AMBIGUOUS. For more information, see the Connectivity Test documentation.

You can use a combination of destination IP address, Compute Engine VM instance, or VPC network to uniquely identify the destination location. Even if the destination IP address is not unique, the source IP location is unique. Usually, the analysis can infer the destination endpoint from route information. If the destination you specify is a VM instance and the instance has multiple network interfaces, then you must also specify either a destination IP address or VPC network to identify the destination interface.
