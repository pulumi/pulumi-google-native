The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. Hostname can be &#34;precise&#34; which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. &#34;foo.example.com&#34;) or &#34;wildcard&#34;, which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. *.example.com).

No other punctuation is allowed. The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateway must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected.
