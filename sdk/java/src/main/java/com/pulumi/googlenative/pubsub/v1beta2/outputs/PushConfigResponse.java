This controls the shape of the envelope (i.e. its fields and metadata). The endpoint version is based on the version of the Pub/Sub API.

The possible values for this attribute are: * `v1beta1`: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1 Pub/Sub API. * `v1` or `v1beta2`: uses the push format defined in the v1 Pub/Sub API.
