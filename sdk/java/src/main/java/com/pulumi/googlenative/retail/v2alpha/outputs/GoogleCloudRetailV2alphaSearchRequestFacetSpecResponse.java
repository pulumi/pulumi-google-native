For example, you may always want to have rating facet returned in the response, but it&#39;s not necessarily to always display the rating facet at the top.

Another example, assuming you have the following facets in the request: * &#34;rating&#34;, enable_dynamic_position = true * &#34;price&#34;, enable_dynamic_position = false * &#34;brands&#34;, enable_dynamic_position = false And also you have a dynamic facets enable, which will generate a facet &#39;gender&#39;.
