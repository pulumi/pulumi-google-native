The following are requirements of `exclude_prefixes`: * Each exclude-prefix can contain any sequence of Unicode characters, to a max length of 1024 bytes when UTF8-encoded, and must not contain Carriage Return or Line Feed characters. Wildcard matching and regular expression matching are not supported. * Each exclude-prefix must omit the leading slash. For example, to exclude the object `s3://my-aws-bucket/logs/y=2015/requests.gz`, specify the exclude-prefix as `logs/y=2015/requests.gz`. * None of the exclude-prefix values can be empty, if specified. * Each exclude-prefix must exclude a distinct portion of the object namespace. No exclude-prefix may be a prefix of another exclude-prefix. * If include_prefixes is specified, then each exclude-prefix must start with the value of a path explicitly included by `include_prefixes`. The max size of `exclude_prefixes` is 1000. For more information, see [Filtering objects from transfers](/storage-transfer/docs/filtering-objects-from-transfers).
