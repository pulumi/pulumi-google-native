/**
 * Creates an entitlement for a customer. Possible error codes: * PERMISSION_DENIED: The customer doesn't belong to the reseller. * INVALID_ARGUMENT: * Required request parameters are missing or invalid. * There is already a customer entitlement for a SKU from the same product family. * INVALID_VALUE: Make sure the OfferId is valid. If it is, contact Google Channel support for further troubleshooting. * NOT_FOUND: The customer or offer resource was not found. * ALREADY_EXISTS: * The SKU was already purchased for the customer. * The customer's primary email already exists. Retry after changing the customer's primary contact email. * CONDITION_NOT_MET or FAILED_PRECONDITION: * The domain required for purchasing a SKU has not been verified. * A pre-requisite SKU required to purchase an Add-On SKU is missing. For example, Google Workspace Business Starter is required to purchase Vault or Drive. * (Developer accounts only) Reseller and resold domain must meet the following naming requirements: * Domain names must start with goog-test. * Domain names must include the reseller domain. * INTERNAL: Any non-user error related to a technical issue in the backend. Contact Cloud Channel support. * UNKNOWN: Any non-user error related to a technical issue in the backend. Contact Cloud Channel support. Return value: The ID of a long-running operation. To get the results of the operation, call the GetOperation method of CloudChannelOperationsService. The Operation metadata will contain an instance of OperationMetadata.
