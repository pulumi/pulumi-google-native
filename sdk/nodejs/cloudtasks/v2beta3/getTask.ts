Cloud Tasks will retry the task according to the RetryConfig. Note that when the request is cancelled, Cloud Tasks will stop listening for the response, but whether the worker stops processing depends on the worker. For example, if the worker is stuck, it may not react to cancelled requests. The default and maximum values depend on the type of request: * For HTTP tasks, the default is 10 minutes. The deadline must be in the interval [15 seconds, 30 minutes]. * For App Engine tasks, 0 indicates that the request has the default deadline. The default deadline depends on the [scaling type](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/how-instances-are-managed#instance_scaling) of the service: 10 minutes for standard apps with automatic scaling, 24 hours for standard apps with manual and basic scaling, and 60 minutes for flex apps. If the request deadline is set, it must be in the interval [15 seconds, 24 hours 15 seconds]. Regardless of the task's `dispatch_deadline`, the app handler will not run for longer than than the service's timeout. We recommend setting the `dispatch_deadline` to at most a few seconds more than the app handler's timeout. For more information see [Timeouts](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-appengine-handlers#timeouts). `dispatch_deadline` will be truncated to the nearest millisecond. The deadline is an approximate deadline.
