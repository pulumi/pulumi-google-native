/**
 * Creates a new conversation. Conversations are auto-completed after 24 hours. Conversation Lifecycle: There are two stages during a conversation: Automated Agent Stage and Assist Stage. For Automated Agent Stage, there will be a dialogflow agent responding to user queries. For Assist Stage, there's no dialogflow agent responding to user queries. But we will provide suggestions which are generated from conversation. If Conversation.conversation_profile is configured for a dialogflow agent, conversation will start from `Automated Agent Stage`, otherwise, it will start from `Assist Stage`. And during `Automated Agent Stage`, once an Intent with Intent.live_agent_handoff is triggered, conversation will transfer to Assist Stage.
 * Auto-naming is currently not supported for this resource.
 * Note - this resource's API doesn't support deletion. When deleted, the resource will persist
 * on Google Cloud even though it will be deleted from Pulumi state.
