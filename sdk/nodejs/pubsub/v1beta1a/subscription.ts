If a subscriber acknowledges after the deadline, the Pub/Sub system may accept the Ack, but it is possible that the message has been already delivered again. Multiple Acks to the message are allowed and will succeed. For push delivery, this value is used to set the request timeout for the call to the push endpoint.

While a message is outstanding (i.e. it has been delivered to a pull subscriber and the subscriber has not yet Acked or Nacked), the Pub/Sub system will not deliver that message to another pull subscriber (on a best-effort basis).
