The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (.), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (/). Annotations that fails to meet these requirements are rejected * The `(*.)google.com/` and `(*.)googleapis.com/` prefixes are reserved for system annotations managed by Service Directory.

They have the same syntax and read/write to the same location in Service Directory.
