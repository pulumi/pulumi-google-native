In this example, these objects will be held intact for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed.
