        Creates a queue. Queues created with this method allow tasks to live for a maximum of 31 days. After a task is 31 days old, the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. WARNING: Using this method may have unintended side effects if you are using an App Engine `queue.yaml` or `queue.xml` file to manage your queues. Read [Overview of Queue Management and queue.yaml](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/queue-yaml) before using this method.

        :param str resource_name: The name of the resource.
        :param pulumi.ResourceOptions opts: Options for the resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['AppEngineHttpTargetArgs']] app_engine_http_target: App Engine HTTP target. An App Engine queue is a queue that has an AppEngineHttpTarget.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: Caller-specified and required in CreateQueue, after which it becomes output only. The queue name. The queue name must have the following format: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID` * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.). For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the queue's location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] parent: Required. The location name in which the queue will be created. For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID` The list of allowed locations can be obtained by calling Cloud Tasks' implementation of ListLocations.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['PullTargetArgs']] pull_target: Pull target. A pull queue is a queue that has a PullTarget.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] purge_time: Output only. The last time this queue was purged. All tasks that were created before this time were purged. A queue can be purged using PurgeQueue, the [App Engine Task Queue SDK, or the Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/deleting-tasks-and-queues#purging_all_tasks_from_a_queue). Purge time will be truncated to the nearest microsecond. Purge time will be unset if the queue has never been purged.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['RateLimitsArgs']] rate_limits: Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts however they control how tasks are attempted in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc).
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['RetryConfigArgs']] retry_config: Settings that determine the retry behavior. * For tasks created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue that were created using Cloud Tasks. Retry settings cannot be set on individual tasks. * For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue which do not have retry settings explicitly set on the task and were created by the App Engine SDK. See [App Engine documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/taskqueue/push/retrying-tasks).
        :param pulumi.Input[str] state: Output only. The state of the queue. `state` can only be changed by called PauseQueue, ResumeQueue, or uploading [queue.yaml/xml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queueref). UpdateQueue cannot be used to change `state`.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['QueueStatsArgs']] stats: Output only. The realtime, informational statistics for a queue. In order to receive the statistics the caller should include this field in the FieldMask.
