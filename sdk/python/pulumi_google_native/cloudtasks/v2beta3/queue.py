For more information, see [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the queue's location. The list of available locations can be obtained by calling ListLocations. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/. * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.
        :param pulumi.Input['RateLimitsArgs'] rate_limits: Rate limits for task dispatches. rate_limits and retry_config are related because they both control task attempts. However they control task attempts in different ways: * rate_limits controls the total rate of dispatches from a queue (i.e. all traffic dispatched from the queue, regardless of whether the dispatch is from a first attempt or a retry). * retry_config controls what happens to particular a task after its first attempt fails. That is, retry_config controls task retries (the second attempt, third attempt, etc). The queue's actual dispatch rate is the result of: * Number of tasks in the queue * User-specified throttling: rate_limits, retry_config, and the queue's state. * System throttling due to `429` (Too Many Requests) or `503` (Service Unavailable) responses from the worker, high error rates, or to smooth sudden large traffic spikes.
        :param pulumi.Input['RetryConfigArgs'] retry_config: Settings that determine the retry behavior. * For tasks created using Cloud Tasks: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue that were created using Cloud Tasks. Retry settings cannot be set on individual tasks. * For tasks created using the App Engine SDK: the queue-level retry settings apply to all tasks in the queue which do not have retry settings explicitly set on the task and were created by the App Engine SDK.

After a task has lived for `task_ttl`, the task will be deleted regardless of whether it was dispatched or not. The `task_ttl` for queues created via queue.yaml/xml is equal to the maximum duration because there is a [storage quota](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/quotas#Task_Queue) for these queues. To view the maximum valid duration, see the documentation for Duration.

After a task is deleted or executed, the task's tombstone is retained for the length of time specified by `tombstone_ttl`. The tombstone is used by task de-duplication; another task with the same name can't be created until the tombstone has expired. For more information about task de-duplication, see the documentation for CreateTaskRequest. Queues created by Cloud Tasks have a default `tombstone_ttl` of 1 hour.
