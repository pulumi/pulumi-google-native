        The set of arguments for constructing a Subnetwork resource.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: URL of the region where the Subnetwork resides. This field can be set only at resource creation time.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] allow_subnet_cidr_routes_overlap: Whether this subnetwork's ranges can conflict with existing static routes. Setting this to true allows this subnetwork's primary and secondary ranges to overlap with (and contain) static routes that have already been configured on the corresponding network. For example if a static route has range 10.1.0.0/16, a subnet range 10.0.0.0/8 could only be created if allow_conflicting_routes=true. Overlapping is only allowed on subnetwork operations; routes whose ranges conflict with this subnetwork's ranges won't be allowed unless route.allow_conflicting_subnetworks is set to true. Typically packets destined to IPs within the subnetwork (which may contain private/sensitive data) are prevented from leaving the virtual network. Setting this field to true will disable this feature. The default value is false and applies to all existing subnetworks and automatically created subnetworks. This field cannot be set to true at resource creation time.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. This field can be set only at resource creation time.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_flow_logs: Whether to enable flow logging for this subnetwork. If this field is not explicitly set, it will not appear in get listings. If not set the default behavior is determined by the org policy, if there is no org policy specified, then it will default to disabled. This field isn't supported with the purpose field set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_cidr_range: The range of internal addresses that are owned by this subnetwork. Provide this property when you create the subnetwork. For example, 10.0.0.0/8 or 100.64.0.0/10. Ranges must be unique and non-overlapping within a network. Only IPv4 is supported. This field is set at resource creation time. The range can be any range listed in the Valid ranges list. The range can be expanded after creation using expandIpCidrRange.
        :param pulumi.Input['SubnetworkIpv6AccessType'] ipv6_access_type: The access type of IPv6 address this subnet holds. It's immutable and can only be specified during creation or the first time the subnet is updated into IPV4_IPV6 dual stack. If the ipv6_type is EXTERNAL then this subnet cannot enable direct path.
        :param pulumi.Input['SubnetworkLogConfigArgs'] log_config: This field denotes the VPC flow logging options for this subnetwork. If logging is enabled, logs are exported to Cloud Logging.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: The name of the resource, provided by the client when initially creating the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: The URL of the network to which this subnetwork belongs, provided by the client when initially creating the subnetwork. This field can be set only at resource creation time.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] private_ip_google_access: Whether the VMs in this subnet can access Google services without assigned external IP addresses. This field can be both set at resource creation time and updated using setPrivateIpGoogleAccess.
        :param pulumi.Input['SubnetworkPrivateIpv6GoogleAccess'] private_ipv6_google_access: The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs in this subnet. This is an expanded field of enablePrivateV6Access. If both fields are set, privateIpv6GoogleAccess will take priority. This field can be both set at resource creation time and updated using patch.
        :param pulumi.Input['SubnetworkPurpose'] purpose: The purpose of the resource. This field can be either PRIVATE_RFC_1918 or INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. A subnetwork with purpose set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. If unspecified, the purpose defaults to PRIVATE_RFC_1918. The enableFlowLogs field isn't supported with the purpose field set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] request_id: An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
        :param pulumi.Input['SubnetworkRole'] role: The role of subnetwork. Currently, this field is only used when purpose = INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. The value can be set to ACTIVE or BACKUP. An ACTIVE subnetwork is one that is currently being used for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. A BACKUP subnetwork is one that is ready to be promoted to ACTIVE or is currently draining. This field can be updated with a patch request.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input['SubnetworkSecondaryRangeArgs']]] secondary_ip_ranges: An array of configurations for secondary IP ranges for VM instances contained in this subnetwork. The primary IP of such VM must belong to the primary ipCidrRange of the subnetwork. The alias IPs may belong to either primary or secondary ranges. This field can be updated with a patch request.
        :param pulumi.Input['SubnetworkStackType'] stack_type: The stack type for the subnet. If set to IPV4_ONLY, new VMs in the subnet are assigned IPv4 addresses only. If set to IPV4_IPV6, new VMs in the subnet can be assigned both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If not specified, IPV4_ONLY is used. This field can be both set at resource creation time and updated using patch.

        :param pulumi.Input[str] description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. This field can be set only at resource creation time.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] enable_flow_logs: Whether to enable flow logging for this subnetwork. If this field is not explicitly set, it will not appear in get listings. If not set the default behavior is determined by the org policy, if there is no org policy specified, then it will default to disabled. This field isn't supported with the purpose field set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] ip_cidr_range: The range of internal addresses that are owned by this subnetwork. Provide this property when you create the subnetwork. For example, 10.0.0.0/8 or 100.64.0.0/10. Ranges must be unique and non-overlapping within a network. Only IPv4 is supported. This field is set at resource creation time. The range can be any range listed in the Valid ranges list. The range can be expanded after creation using expandIpCidrRange.
        :param pulumi.Input['SubnetworkIpv6AccessType'] ipv6_access_type: The access type of IPv6 address this subnet holds. It's immutable and can only be specified during creation or the first time the subnet is updated into IPV4_IPV6 dual stack. If the ipv6_type is EXTERNAL then this subnet cannot enable direct path.
        :param pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['SubnetworkLogConfigArgs']] log_config: This field denotes the VPC flow logging options for this subnetwork. If logging is enabled, logs are exported to Cloud Logging.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] name: The name of the resource, provided by the client when initially creating the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] network: The URL of the network to which this subnetwork belongs, provided by the client when initially creating the subnetwork. This field can be set only at resource creation time.
        :param pulumi.Input[bool] private_ip_google_access: Whether the VMs in this subnet can access Google services without assigned external IP addresses. This field can be both set at resource creation time and updated using setPrivateIpGoogleAccess.
        :param pulumi.Input['SubnetworkPrivateIpv6GoogleAccess'] private_ipv6_google_access: The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs in this subnet. This is an expanded field of enablePrivateV6Access. If both fields are set, privateIpv6GoogleAccess will take priority. This field can be both set at resource creation time and updated using patch.
        :param pulumi.Input['SubnetworkPurpose'] purpose: The purpose of the resource. This field can be either PRIVATE_RFC_1918 or INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. A subnetwork with purpose set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. If unspecified, the purpose defaults to PRIVATE_RFC_1918. The enableFlowLogs field isn't supported with the purpose field set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] region: URL of the region where the Subnetwork resides. This field can be set only at resource creation time.
        :param pulumi.Input[str] request_id: An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
        :param pulumi.Input['SubnetworkRole'] role: The role of subnetwork. Currently, this field is only used when purpose = INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. The value can be set to ACTIVE or BACKUP. An ACTIVE subnetwork is one that is currently being used for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. A BACKUP subnetwork is one that is ready to be promoted to ACTIVE or is currently draining. This field can be updated with a patch request.
        :param pulumi.Input[Sequence[pulumi.Input[pulumi.InputType['SubnetworkSecondaryRangeArgs']]]] secondary_ip_ranges: An array of configurations for secondary IP ranges for VM instances contained in this subnetwork. The primary IP of such VM must belong to the primary ipCidrRange of the subnetwork. The alias IPs may belong to either primary or secondary ranges. This field can be updated with a patch request.
        :param pulumi.Input['SubnetworkStackType'] stack_type: The stack type for the subnet. If set to IPV4_ONLY, new VMs in the subnet are assigned IPv4 addresses only. If set to IPV4_IPV6, new VMs in the subnet can be assigned both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If not specified, IPV4_ONLY is used. This field can be both set at resource creation time and updated using patch.
