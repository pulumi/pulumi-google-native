This additionally functions to facilitate the allowlist feature. RPZs can be applied to multiple levels in the (eventually org, folder, project, network) hierarchy. If a rule is applied at a higher level of the hierarchy, adding a passthru rule at a lower level will supersede that, and a query from an affected vm to that domain will be exempt from the RPZ and proceed to normal resolution behavior.
